# To-Do App

A simple to-do app that allows users add, check and remove tasks from their to-do list.
Developed using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.


## Local Storage Availability
Before using localStorage, it's a good practice to check if it's available in the browser. If not, the implementation would break.

## Functionality Separation
I have implemented a seperation of concerns for the logics in my app.js to make the functions more modular and easier to understand.
